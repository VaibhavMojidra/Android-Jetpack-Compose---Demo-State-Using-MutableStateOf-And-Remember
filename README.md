# Android Jetpack Compose Demo State Using MutableStateOf And Remember

Jetpack Compose provides a declarative way to define UI components and encourages the use of immutable state. You can manage state within a composable function using the remember and mutableStateOf functions. These functions allow you to create and update state variables that automatically trigger recomposition when their values change.
